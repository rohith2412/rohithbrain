          <p className="text-xl mb-4">What if the secret to living longer, healthier, and more energetically wasn't found in expensive supplements or extreme diets, but in simple daily habits practiced by the world's longest-living populations? Research from Blue Zones—regions where people routinely live to 100 and beyond—reveals that longevity isn't just about genetics; it's about lifestyle choices, particularly what we eat and how we eat it.</p>
          
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">The longevity diet isn't a restrictive eating plan but rather a collection of science-backed habits that work synergistically to slow cellular aging, reduce inflammation, and boost energy levels. These practices, observed in places like Okinawa, Japan, and Sardinia, Italy, have been validated by decades of nutritional research and epidemiological studies.</p>

          <p className="text-xl mb-4">In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore 10 daily habits that form the foundation of a longevity-focused lifestyle, each backed by scientific evidence and practical enough to implement starting today.</p>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">1. Practice the 80% Rule (Hara Hachi Bu)</h2>
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">The Okinawan practice of "hara hachi bu" involves eating until you're 80% full rather than completely satisfied. This ancient wisdom aligns perfectly with modern research on caloric restriction and its anti-aging benefits.</p>
          
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">Studies show that moderate caloric restriction can activate longevity genes called sirtuins, which help repair cellular damage and extend lifespan. By stopping at 80% fullness, you naturally reduce caloric intake by 10-20% without feeling deprived.</p>

          <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-4">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">How to Practice Hara Hachi Bu:</h3>
            <ul className="space-y-2 text-xl ml-6">
              <li>• Eat slowly and mindfully, taking at least 20 minutes per meal</li>
              <li>• Put your fork down between bites</li>
              <li>• Stop eating when you feel satisfied but could eat a bit more</li>
              <li>• Use smaller plates to naturally control portion sizes</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">2. Embrace a Plant-Forward Diet</h2>
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">Centenarians in Blue Zones consume a diet that's 90-95% plant-based, rich in vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and fruits. This doesn't mean complete vegetarianism, but rather making plants the star of every meal.</p>
          
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">Plant foods are packed with antioxidants, fiber, and phytonutrients that combat oxidative stress and inflammation—two key drivers of aging. Research published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that plant-forward diets reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by 16% and all-cause mortality by 25%.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Daily Plant Goals:</h3>
          <ul className="space-y-2 text-xl ml-6 mb-4">
            <li>• Fill half your plate with colorful vegetables at each meal</li>
            <li>• Include at least one serving of legumes daily</li>
            <li>• Choose whole grains over refined options</li>
            <li>• Snack on nuts, seeds, and fresh fruits</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">3. Make Legumes Your Longevity Superfood</h2>
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">Beans, lentils, chickpeas, and other legumes are the cornerstone of every Blue Zone diet. These nutritional powerhouses provide plant protein, fiber, folate, and resistant starch that feeds beneficial gut bacteria.</p>
          
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">A study following 785 people for seven years found that for every 20 grams of legumes consumed daily, the risk of death decreased by 8%. Legumes also help stabilize blood sugar, reduce cholesterol, and provide sustained energy without the crashes associated with processed foods.</p>

          <div className="bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-4">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Easy Ways to Add Legumes Daily:</h3>
            <ul className="space-y-2 text-xl ml-6">
              <li>• Add white beans to your morning smoothie</li>
              <li>• Include lentils in soups and salads</li>
              <li>• Make hummus your go-to snack</li>
              <li>• Try bean-based pasta alternatives</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">4. Choose Healthy Fats Wisely</h2>
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">Not all fats are created equal when it comes to longevity. Blue Zone populations consume plenty of healthy fats from sources like olive oil, nuts, avocados, and fatty fish, while avoiding processed and trans fats.</p>
          
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">Extra virgin olive oil, a staple in Mediterranean Blue Zones, contains powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds. Studies show that people who consume olive oil daily have a 13% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and improved cognitive function.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Longevity Fat Sources:</h3>
          <ul className="space-y-2 text-xl ml-6 mb-4">
            <li>• Extra virgin olive oil for cooking and dressing</li>
            <li>• Raw nuts and seeds (1-2 handfuls daily)</li>
            <li>• Avocados for creamy texture and satiety</li>
            <li>• Fatty fish like salmon and sardines (2-3 times weekly)</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">5. Limit Meat Consumption</h2>
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">While not strictly vegetarian, Blue Zone populations consume meat sparingly—typically as a flavoring agent rather than the main course. They average about 2 ounces of meat per day, often reserving it for special occasions or using it to enhance plant-based dishes.</p>
          
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">Research consistently shows that excessive red meat consumption is linked to increased inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. By treating meat as a condiment rather than a centerpiece, you can enjoy its flavor while maximizing the longevity benefits of plant foods.</p>

          <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-4">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Meat Reduction Strategies:</h3>
            <ul className="space-y-2 text-xl ml-6">
              <li>• Implement "Meatless Monday" and gradually expand</li>
              <li>• Use meat as a flavor enhancer in vegetable dishes</li>
              <li>• Try plant-based proteins like tempeh and tofu</li>
              <li>• When eating meat, choose grass-fed and organic options</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">6. Drink Water First, Wine Second</h2>
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">Proper hydration is fundamental to healthy aging, supporting cellular function, nutrient transport, and toxin elimination. Blue Zone populations prioritize water while enjoying moderate amounts of wine, particularly red wine rich in resveratrol.</p>
          
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">Studies suggest that moderate wine consumption (1-2 glasses daily with meals) may contribute to longevity through its antioxidant properties and social aspects. However, the key is moderation and quality—cheap, processed wines don't offer the same benefits.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Optimal Hydration Habits:</h3>
          <ul className="space-y-2 text-xl ml-6 mb-4">
            <li>• Start each day with a large glass of water</li>
            <li>• Drink water before meals to aid digestion</li>
            <li>• If you drink alcohol, limit to 1-2 glasses of quality wine with food</li>
            <li>• Herbal teas count toward hydration goals</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">7. Eliminate Processed Foods and Added Sugars</h2>
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">Blue Zone populations consume virtually no processed foods, refined sugars, or artificial ingredients. Their diets consist of whole, minimally processed foods that their great-grandparents would recognize.</p>
          
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">Processed foods and added sugars drive inflammation, insulin resistance, and cellular aging through advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Research shows that people who consume the most ultra-processed foods have a 62% higher risk of premature death compared to those who eat the least.</p>

          <div className="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-4">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Foods to Minimize or Eliminate:</h3>
            <ul className="space-y-2 text-xl ml-6">
              <li>• Sugary beverages and sodas</li>
              <li>• Packaged snacks and convenience foods</li>
              <li>• Refined grains and white bread</li>
              <li>• Foods with ingredient lists longer than 5 items</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">8. Time Your Eating Windows</h2>
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">Many Blue Zone populations naturally practice time-restricted eating, consuming their largest meal at breakfast or lunch and eating lighter dinners earlier in the evening. This aligns with our circadian rhythms and optimizes metabolic function.</p>
          
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">Research on intermittent fasting shows that giving your digestive system regular breaks can improve insulin sensitivity, promote cellular repair through autophagy, and potentially extend lifespan. The key is finding a sustainable eating window that works with your lifestyle.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Timing Strategies:</h3>
          <ul className="space-y-2 text-xl ml-6 mb-4">
            <li>• Eat your largest meal earlier in the day</li>
            <li>• Finish eating 2-3 hours before bedtime</li>
            <li>• Consider a 12-14 hour overnight fast</li>
            <li>• Listen to your natural hunger cues</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">9. Prioritize Social Eating</h2>
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">In Blue Zones, meals are social events shared with family and friends. This practice promotes mindful eating, better digestion, and stronger social connections—all crucial factors for longevity and mental health.</p>
          
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">Research shows that people who eat alone regularly have higher rates of depression, anxiety, and unhealthy eating behaviors. Social meals naturally slow down eating pace, improve food choices, and provide emotional nourishment alongside physical nutrition.</p>

          <div className="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-4">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Creating Social Meal Experiences:</h3>
            <ul className="space-y-2 text-xl ml-6">
              <li>• Schedule regular family dinners without devices</li>
              <li>• Cook and share meals with friends</li>
              <li>• Join community dining events or potlucks</li>
              <li>• Practice gratitude before meals</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">10. Stay Consistent with Small Changes</h2>
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">The most important aspect of the longevity diet isn't perfection—it's consistency. Blue Zone populations don't follow strict rules but maintain healthy eating patterns as part of their cultural lifestyle, passed down through generations.</p>
          
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">Research on habit formation shows that small, sustainable changes are more effective than dramatic overhauls. Focus on implementing one or two habits at a time, allowing them to become automatic before adding new ones.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Building Sustainable Habits:</h3>
          <ul className="space-y-2 text-xl ml-6 mb-4">
            <li>• Start with one habit and practice for 21 days</li>
            <li>• Track your progress without judgment</li>
            <li>• Allow for flexibility and occasional indulgences</li>
            <li>• Focus on progress, not perfection</li>
          </ul>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Science Behind Longevity Nutrition</h2>
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">The longevity diet works through multiple biological mechanisms that slow aging at the cellular level. These include reducing oxidative stress through antioxidant-rich foods, minimizing inflammation with omega-3 fatty acids and polyphenols, and supporting healthy gut microbiome diversity through fiber-rich plant foods.</p>
          
          <p className="text-xl mb-4">Additionally, practices like caloric restriction and intermittent fasting activate cellular repair processes called autophagy, where cells clean out damaged components and regenerate. This biological housekeeping is crucial for maintaining youthful function as we age.</p>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-8">
